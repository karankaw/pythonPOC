#This program tells us how to use continuation in Longer Strings

# \ Backslash is String contnuation character in Python Strings
# Space mattters here , will be printed as such
# No Begging Quotes at each beginning and end
textStr = "Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah \
Blah1 Blah2 Blah3 Blah4 Blah5 Blah6"
print(textStr)

print("Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah \
Blah1 Blah2 Blah3 Blah4 Blah5 Blah6")



# Implicit Concatenation - Its special for print method - same line below arguments
# Tab space matter must have same Indentation
# Notice How all strings end in Quotes
print("Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah "
      "Blah1 Blah2 Blah3 Blah4 Blah5 Blah6") 


# Comma separated String and Numbers - Different Types
# Can be on separate Lines, Indentation does not matter here
